## Multi-Language Support

Spodkast uses ElevenLabs' **`eleven_multilingual_v2`** model, which natively supports 29 languages:

| Code | Language   | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| `en` | English    | Primary — Rachel voice (calm, warm) |
| `pl` | Polish     | Native multilingual support |
| `es` | Spanish    | Native multilingual support |

### Adding More Languages

1. Find a suitable voice in the [ElevenLabs Voice Library](https://elevenlabs.io/app/voice-library)
   - Filter by language
   - Look for "calm", "warm", or "storyteller" style voices
   - Copy the Voice ID

2. Add to `.env`:
   ```env
   VOICE_ID_DE=<voice_id_for_german>
   ```

3. Extend `app/config.py`:
   ```python
   voice_id_de: str = Field(default="...", env="VOICE_ID_DE")

   @property
   def voice_map(self) -> Dict[str, str]:
       return {
           "en": self.voice_id_en,
           "pl": self.voice_id_pl,
           "es": self.voice_id_es,
           "de": self.voice_id_de,   # ← add here
       }
   ```

### Supported Languages (eleven_multilingual_v2)

English, Polish, Spanish, German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Hindi, Arabic, Czech, Chinese, Japanese, Hungarian, Korean, Dutch, Turkish, Swedish, Romanian, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish, Slovak, Croatian, Malay, Tamil, Ukrainian, Filipino, Bulgarian, Greek.

## Voice Tuning

The narration voice is tuned for calm "goodnight read" style in `app/tts.py`:

```python
CALM_VOICE_SETTINGS = VoiceSettings(
    stability=0.80,        # High stability → steady, consistent delivery
    similarity_boost=0.75, # Moderate → natural sound
    style=0.10,            # Low style → minimal expressiveness, calm tone
    use_speaker_boost=False # Keeps voice gentle, not projected
)
```

To adjust the feel:
- **More expressive**: increase `style` (0.3–0.5)
- **More consistent**: increase `stability` (0.85–0.95)
- **More dramatic**: increase `style` and decrease `stability`

---

## Intro/Outro Audio

Place audio files in `audio/samples/`:

```
audio/samples/
├── intro.mp3      ← played before narration
├── outro.mp3      ← played after narration
└── README.md      ← tips and free music resources
```

The mixer applies a **1.5-second crossfade** between segments for smooth transitions.

## Session Persistence & Multi-Device Access

Spodkast uses a lightweight **SQLite database** (`spodkast.db` by default) to persist sessions and synthesis jobs across restarts and devices.

### Database Schema

```
sessions
  id               TEXT  PRIMARY KEY   — 12-char hex ID returned by /podcast/scripts
  created_at       TEXT               — ISO-8601 UTC timestamp
  device_info      TEXT               — optional free-form tag (e.g. "laptop", "iPhone")
  operator_message TEXT               — Claude's message when source material was insufficient

episodes
  session_id  TEXT  REFERENCES sessions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
  idx         INT                    — 1-based episode index
  title       TEXT
  summary     TEXT                   — always present (from conspect)
  text        TEXT                   — NULL until expanded via /expand

jobs
  id          TEXT  PRIMARY KEY       — 12-char hex ID
  session_id  TEXT                   — linked session (may be NULL)
  episode_idx INT                    — linked episode index (may be NULL)
  status      TEXT                   — pending | running | done | failed
  created_at  TEXT
  output_path TEXT                   — path to generated MP3 on disk
  filename    TEXT
  error       TEXT
```

Sessions are retained for **7 days**; synthesis jobs for **7 days**.
Expired rows are pruned lazily on the next write operation.

### Cross-Device Usage

1. **Start a session on Device A** — call `POST /podcast/scripts` to get a `session_id`.
2. **Resume on Device B** — call `GET /podcast/sessions` to list all sessions, or
   `GET /podcast/sessions/{session_id}` to fetch a specific one by ID.
3. **Download a synthesized file** — call `GET /podcast/jobs/{job_id}/download` from
   any device, as long as both devices share the same `OUTPUT_DIR` (or a network mount).

For a networked multi-device setup, point `DB_PATH` and `OUTPUT_DIR` at a shared volume:

```env
DB_PATH=/shared/spodkast.db
OUTPUT_DIR=/shared/output
```

> **Note**: SQLite WAL mode is enabled, so multiple concurrent readers are safe.
> For high-concurrency write scenarios, consider upgrading to PostgreSQL.

### New Cross-Device API Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/podcast/sessions` | List all persisted sessions (newest first) |
| `GET` | `/podcast/sessions/{id}` | Retrieve a single session |
| `DELETE` | `/podcast/sessions/{id}` | Delete a session and its episodes |
| `GET` | `/podcast/sessions/{id}/jobs` | List synthesis jobs for a session |
